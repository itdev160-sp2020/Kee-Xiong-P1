                        <br>
                        <p>We provide in-home personal care services for those who qualify. Highlander will work with you to develop a plan of care to assist you with your activities of daily living needs as determined by your condition and in accordance with your primary physician’s order.</p>

                        <br>
                        <p>You need to fill out an application and sign a release of healthcare information so that we can obtain your medical information and an MD order to assess for the need for home care services from your primary care physician. Once the information is received, an assessment visit will be scheduled with you by one of our Registered Nurses and conducted in your home to evaluate your need for home care services. During the assessment, the patient and family need to fully cooperate with the nurse in order for the nurse to make a complete and accurate assessment. Please provide all necessary medical information to ensure you get the best care possible.

                        <li><b>What are the qualifications for personal care services?</b></li>
                        <br>
                        <p>You must have a medical need and be functionally limited in providing care for yourself such as bathing, dressing, grooming, lighthouse keeping, and cooking. The assessment nurse will contact you to schedule an assessment. The assessment will take approximately 1-2 hours.</p>

                        <br>
                        <p>The number of hours varies and depends on your health conditions, abilities, M.D. approval, insurance approval and your physical needs. The numbers of hours and care plan will be updated every 50 to 60 days as needed to insure the best and appropriate care is provided.

                        <li><b>Can I have my friend or family member to be my care taker or PCW?</b></li>
                        <br>
                        <p>Yes, Highlander will honor your decision to choose a friend or relative whom you trust and are comfortable with to provide care for you. However, that person cannot be legally responsible or your, such as a parent of a minor or a legal guardian. That person will need to go through a hiring process with Highlander which will require him/her to fill out an application, pass a background check and must get TB screening. If the potential employee is accepted, an orientation and training is required. That PCW will then work under the supervision of your RN Case Manager. If you do not have a friend or family member who is able/willing to be your PCW (caretaker), don’t worry. Highlander also has agency Personal Care Workers who can provide care for you.

                        <br>
                        <p>In most case, your insurance or state Medicaid (T-19) and HMO will pay for the services. If you do not have insurance or Medicaid (T-19), you can go and apply at your County Health and Human Service Department. We also accept private pay and our intake service personnel will work with you to ensure you get proper information and help.</p>
